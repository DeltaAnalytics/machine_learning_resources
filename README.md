# python_tutorials: Python code and ipython notebooks

We'll use this repo to share technical demos and tutorials

The notebook `tutorial - pandas_ply, dplython, rpy2` has a demo of
some libraries that we used in the DeltAnalytics presentation at
ODSC 2016, tools we used in our churn analysis for Eneza Education
